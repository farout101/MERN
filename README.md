# Hackathon Interview

## Intro
Hi, I’m a software engineering student, and my main focus is on web development, game development, and IoT devices. I started my journey into IT when I was 15, initially as a cybersecurity enthusiast. But over time, I realized I enjoy building things more than defending them, and that’s how I ended up becoming a web developer.

Besides web development, I also dabble in game development and IoT projects. I’ve always wanted to be a tech geek, so I’m constantly learning and trying new things. Sharing what I’ve learned with my friends has always been something I love, and the moment I became the "go-to tech guy" in my group was honestly one of the best feelings in the world. It really pushed me to keep learning and improving myself.

I believe that staying updated with the latest tech trends is super important because technology is evolving so fast. The skills that worked for programmers in 2014 don’t cut it in 2024. That’s why I’m always exploring new tools and ideas—I want to keep growing and becoming the best programmer I can be.

So far, I’ve participated in quite a few hackathons. I won Second Runner-Up at the Samsung Innovation Campus and got the Resilient Builder Award in Build Myanmar’s Flood Response Hackathon. While I haven’t had formal job experience yet, these competitions have taught me a lot and showed me that I’m capable of much more.

I’m also excited with this hackathon about what’s ahead and looking forward to pushing my limits even further.

## Why You Like to Work in Japanese Companies
"I am deeply inspired by the work culture of Japanese companies, especially their emphasis on precision, teamwork, and innovation. Japanese companies are known for their attention to detail and high standards, which align with my own values as a programmer. I also admire the way Japanese organizations prioritize continuous improvement, or 'Kaizen.' This mindset resonates with me because I’m always looking to grow and improve in my career. Working in such an environment would not only be a great opportunity for me to learn but also to contribute with my skills and creativity."

## How do you approach solving a problem during a hackathon?
"During a hackathon, I like to keep things simple and focused. First, I break the problem into smaller parts to understand what’s really needed. Then, I brainstorm possible solutions, usually starting with what I already know or tools I’m familiar with to save time. Once the team agrees on an approach, I quickly build a basic version—like an MVP—so we can test if it works and make adjustments if needed. I always prioritize communication within the team to stay aligned and tackle issues together. It’s all about being efficient, adaptable, and staying calm under pressure."
